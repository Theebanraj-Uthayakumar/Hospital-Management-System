# Hospital-Management-System
SLIIIT || 3rd Year 2nd Semester || Model Code - SE3080
This project is based on the Hospital management system. All the operations are done manually in existing hospitals.
They store all the records as hard copies in physical storage. This system is developed as a solution for that. Four
main sections were identified under this system. Doctor's details management, camping details management and
Operation history detail Management are the main four sections. In doctor details management, all the details about
doctors who work in the hospital are stored in the system. There are ambulances in hospitals. This system is designed
to store all the ambulance details and driver details in a single space. Generally, Hospitals organize health camps
(Blood donations, Eye-caring sessions). All the camping data can be stored in the system and patients can view the
list of upcoming camping through the system. In each hospital, there are operation theatres. All the operations data
are recorded in books. But using this system, theatre staff can add all the details about the surgeries to the system.
Admin or the hospital head can generate the reports about doctor's details, camps details, vehicle details and
operation details if he or she wants. This web application can overcome many problems faced in hospital operations.
During system development, several system access and editing restrictions should be developed to prevent
unauthorized access to system data.
